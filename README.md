## mod_to_mp4

command line tool for converting .MOD files to .mp4<br>

I made this tool for converting files from my old video camcorder (canon FS100).

### Requirements

- [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

### Usage

add the script to your ```PATH``` and then run <br>
```$ mod_to_mp4 [directory]```<br>
where the directory contains the mod files you want to convert.
